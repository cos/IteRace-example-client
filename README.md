This is a very small example of using IteRace a library. It can be used as a starting point for a project.

## Setup
1. (Follow the steps for installing IteRace)[https://github.com/cos/IteRace]
2. Go into IteRace's directory and `sbt publishLocal`
3. Clone this project `clone https://github.com/cos/IteRace-example-client.git` (someplace else, not in IteRace's directory)
4. Rename whatever is needed in `build.sbt` to match your project
5. `sbt compile`
6. `sbt test`
